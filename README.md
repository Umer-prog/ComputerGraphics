🎨 Computer Graphics Course Projects with OpenGL (C++)
Welcome to the Computer Graphics Course repository! This collection of projects demonstrates fundamental and advanced graphics techniques using OpenGL in C++. Each project covers key concepts like transformations, modeling, lighting, and animations.

📚 Course Topics Covered
Raster Images: Understanding pixel maps and pixel depth.
Graphics Primitives: Drawing basic shapes like points, lines, and triangles.
World Window & Viewport: Mapping coordinates between world and screen space.
Clipping: Techniques for cutting parts of objects outside the viewable region.
Modeling: Different approaches to represent objects (polygonal, spline-based, procedural).
Transformations: Translation, rotation, scaling, and affine transformations.
Animation: Creating smooth frame-based animations.
